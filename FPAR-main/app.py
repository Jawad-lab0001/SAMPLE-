"""
    This script serves as the entry point for the application. It is responsible for importing necessary modules and executing the main functionality of the application.

    To get started, import the required modules from their respective files. For instance, if you have a module named 'promptuser.py' that contains a function 'promptUser', you can import it as follows:
        ```
        from promptuser import promptUser
        ```
    After importing the necessary modules, you can call the functions within this script to run your application.

    Note:
        - It is recommended to implement selection statements and error handling to manage different user inputs and potential errors gracefully.
